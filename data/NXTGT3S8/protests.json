As i've seen him approaching i left more room to go into T10 to avoid collision. Despite i had the corner as i was still ahead, Maciej hit the curb and unsettled his car. Resulting to jump his car into my side and spinning me round. \nAs this was the last lap of the sprint race, there was no need for such action in the final corners. Because of the incident i lost my P2 in class and ended P4. Maciej still got P3, wich is a bit unfair.
