Andy reacts to this by starting to squeeze while I stay straight (he started pointing his car to the apex at the 100m board invading my space and line) even tho I’m along side enough to claim the corner. Which ultimately results in the gap closing and running me off the track into the curb which then spins us both. Resulting in lots of places and time lost.","round_id":6,"protest_id":6042,"score_event":"Endurance Race","timestamp":1746874924886,"resolved":1},{"protesting_driver_id":532447,"protesting_driver_name":"Paul N T Williams","protested_driver_id":712518,"protested_driver_name":"Steven De Greveleer","round_name":"6-Bathu","round_no":"6","event":"1","lap":"9-10","corner":"FCY","driver_statement":"Overtaken during 10 second countdown which race is neutralised and end of FCY overtaken before green announced.","round_id":6,"protest_id":6043,"score_event":"Endurance Race","timestamp":1747032446113,"resolved":1},{"protesting_driver_id":532447,"protesting_driver_name":"Paul N T Williams","protested_driver_id":1095068,"protested_driver_name":"Adam Wilson-Weir","round_name":"6-Bathu","round_no":"6","event":"1","lap":"9-10","corner":"FCY","driver_statement":"Overtaken during 10 second countdown which race is neutralised and end of FCY overtaken before green announced.","round_id":6,"protest_id":6044,"score_event":"Endurance Race","timestamp":1747032473651,"resolved":1},{"protesting_driver_id":532447,"protesting_driver_name":"Paul N T Williams","protested_driver_id":888953,"protested_driver_name":"Wesley Lewin","round_name":"6-Bathu","round_no":"6","event":"1","lap":"9-10","corner":"FCY","driver_statement":"Overtaken during 10 second countdown which race is neutralised and end of FCY overtaken before green announced.","round_id":6,"protest_id":6045,"score_event":"Endurance Race","timestamp":1747032500700,"resolved":1},{"protesting_driver_id":430559,"protesting_driver_name":"Jesse Payne-Wilkins","protested_driver_id":717473,"protested_driver_name":"Shaun F Schutte","round_name":"6-Bathu","round_no":"6","event":"1","lap":"10","corner":"2","driver_statement":"Coming into braking zone Shaun was well over a car length behind, but decided to try and overtake anyway resulting in him T-boning me, which meant I had to tow because damage was so bad","round_id":6,"protest_id":6046,"score_event":"Endurance Race","timestamp":1747032549698,"resolved":1},{"protesting_driver_id":417499,"protesting_driver_name":"Jamie Dorey","protested_driver_id":717473,"protested_driver_name":"Shaun F Schutte","round_name":"6-Bathu","round_no":"6","event":"1","lap":"25","corner":"2","driver_statement":"Dive bomb destroying my race, no apology, no attempt to redress positions.","round_id":6,"protest_id":6047,"score_event":"Endurance Race","timestamp":1747032605231,"resolved":1},{"protesting_driver_id":532447,"protesting_driver_name":"Paul N T Williams","protested_driver_id":435038,"protested_driver_name":"Jochen Siegert","round_name":"7-Algar","round_no":"7","event":"1","lap":"0","corner":"0","driver_statement":"Driver Changed cars.","round_id":7,"protest_id":7048,"score_event":"Sprint Race Fastest Lap","timestamp":1747067454220,"resolved":1},{"protesting_driver_id":541161,"protesting_driver_name":"Jonathan Berry","protested_driver_id":888953,"protested_driver_name":"Wesley Lewin","round_name":"7-Algar","round_no":"7","event":"101","lap":"1","corner":"11","driver_statement":"approaching the corner I'm a car length or 2 ahead, his line is incredibly compromised and it was always my corner but I knew he was there and i left him enough room but at the point of the initial apex he is understeering into me and car pointing straight ahead and not towards the corner.
